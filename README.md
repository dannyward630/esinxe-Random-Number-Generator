This is a Random Number Generator (RNG) for Python, C#, C++, C and Ruby (Other languages coming soon)

This is a unique generator in that it chooses value y from key x using the function e^sin(x^e), instead of running values through an algorithm.

The primary advantage this RNG has over others I will demonstrate by an example: If you want to generate the nth random value in a series beginning at the seed value, a standard generator would calculate every value from the seed until the nth. By using a function instead of an algorithm, this generator can calculate the nth value instantly, without having to cycle through every previous one. In certain applications, especially in the gaming industry, this can become a bottleneck when procedurally generating terrain far from the starting (seed) value. I discovered the issue earlier in 2022 when developing a Minecraft clone.

I can't find any repetitions in the first 100 billion digits, but if you can find any please bring it to my notice. I am not experienced in detecting patterns in data sets, so any feedback would be appreciated.

As you can probably see, this project in it's infancy. Any comments, tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
